The entire team, including the production designers, art directors, and even the writers, must work together to accomplish the enormous task of recreating a particular era that is now long-gone, especially if it is done with props and sets rather than special effects. Furthermore, using artefacts like a storefront, an old muscle car, or costumes aren’t the only ways to recreate virtual history. It includes the tenor and way of life for the time period the movie chooses to portray.</p><p>The world we live in is full of narratives to be told, ranging in scope from intimate family sagas to conflicts that altered the course of history as we know it, and Prime Video is home to a number of period/historical films with some exceptional craftsmanship on display. Even a cursory glance at the list would show that the Second World War is unquestionably the most well-researched historical event, but there are other treasures as well, spanning from Biblical times to the relatively recent end of the 20th century itself.

Every year, Hollywood produces thousands of character and true-life biographies, but ‘A Beautiful Mind’ is so much more than that—in addition to being flawlessly created. The movie follows the career of brilliant mathematician John Nash, from his early career’s game-changing discovery to his involvement in the government’s decryption of secret messages, his development of paranoid <a href=#>schizophrenia</a>, to his eventual recognition with a Nobel Prize quite late in his life. From describing an astonishing voyage to examining the beauty of the human mind itself, it is certainly beautiful.</p><h3></h3><h3><span id=American_Traitor_The_Trial_of_Axis_Sally_2021>American Traitor: The Trial of Axis Sally (2021)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-28-at-1.15.49-PM.jpg alt="best historical movies on amazon prime india,best ancient historical movies on amazon prime,best historical movies on netflix,best free historical movies on amazon prime,indian history movies on amazon prime,best historical series on amazon prime,historical movies on amazon prime video,best historical movies on hotstar,best historical movies on amazon prime,best historical drama movies on amazon prime,best indian historical movies on amazon prime,best historical war movies on amazon prime,best historical movies to watch on amazon prime,best historical romance movies on amazon prime,historical movies to watch on amazon prime,great historical movies on amazon prime" width=512 height=302 sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The film “American Traitor: The Trial of Axis Sally,” directed by Michael Polish, depicts the tale of Mildred Gillars, an American woman who broadcasts Nazi propaganda during World War II. After the war, she is apprehended in Berlin and brought back to the US, where she is put on trial for treason. James Laughlin, Mildred’s attorney, is portrayed by Al Pacino. He makes the argument that his client was similarly compelled to comply with Nazi demands under danger of being sent to a concentration camp. Even though the movie doesn’t measure up to Pacino’s other creations, he still manages to draw you into the narrative.</p><h3></h3><h3><span id=Badamasi_Portrait_of_a_General_2021>Badamasi (Portrait of a General) (2021)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Emelonyes-lens-on-Portrait-of-a-General-.jpg alt="best historical movies on amazon prime india,best ancient historical movies on amazon prime,best historical movies on netflix,best free historical movies on amazon prime,indian history movies on amazon prime,best historical series on amazon prime,historical movies on amazon prime video,best historical movies on hotstar,best historical movies on amazon prime,best historical drama movies on amazon prime,best indian historical movies on amazon prime,best historical war movies on amazon prime,best historical movies to watch on amazon prime,best historical romance movies on amazon prime,historical movies to watch on amazon prime,great historical movies on amazon prime" width=512 height=288 sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>‘Badamasi (Portrait of a General)’ is a Nigerian-approved biographical film that portrays the narrative of the actual former military chief and head of state Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida (IBB). It was written and directed by Obi Emelonye. The movie follows Badamasi’s rise from the town of Wushishi in northern Nigeria to the country’s political elite, portraying the general as a flawed person who tries to lead his nation through a turbulent period. At the age of 14, Badamasi lost both of his parents, and he finally enlists in the army. He steadily moves up the ranks thanks to his practically unmatched charisma and brilliance, becoming a significant figure in Nigerian military affairs. Additionally, the movie provides a generally accurate portrayal of the Nigerian civil war and Badamasi’s involvement in it.</p><h3><span id=Enemy_at_the_Gates_2001>Enemy at the Gates (2001)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Enemy-at-the-Gates.jpg alt="best historical movies on amazon prime india,best ancient historical movies on amazon prime,best historical movies on netflix,best free historical movies on amazon prime,indian history movies on amazon prime,best historical series on amazon prime,historical movies on amazon prime video,best historical movies on hotstar,best historical movies on amazon prime,best historical drama movies on amazon prime,best indian historical movies on amazon prime,best historical war movies on amazon prime,best historical movies to watch on amazon prime,best historical romance movies on amazon prime,historical movies to watch on amazon prime,great historical movies on amazon prime" width=640 height=360 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In contrast to most fictionalised accounts of war, the sniper battle between a Soviet and a German sniper during the Battle of Stalingrad is the subject of “Enemy at the Gates,” a partially fictionalised account. However, unlike most fictionalised accounts of war, the ‘fiction’ portion of this one serves only as entertainment, not as propaganda. Jude Law and Ed Harris, who play the duelling snipers engaged in a struggle to the death, are totally convincing in their performances. It does not attempt to be perfect, nor is it an accurate description of the Battle of Stalingrad. An exciting military drama that focuses more on action than nationalism or anti-war gravity.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u3aa7b877639e850aa02e5a665a7eef2b><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Time Travel with the Best Historical Shows on Netflix</span></a><h3><span id=Hansan_Rising_Dragon_2022>Hansan: Rising Dragon (2022)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-07-225337.jpg alt="best historical movies on amazon prime india,best ancient historical movies on amazon prime,best historical movies on netflix,best free historical movies on amazon prime,indian history movies on amazon prime,best historical series on amazon prime,historical movies on amazon prime video,best historical movies on hotstar,best historical movies on amazon prime,best historical drama movies on amazon prime,best indian historical movies on amazon prime,best historical war movies on amazon prime,best historical movies to watch on amazon prime,best historical romance movies on amazon prime,historical movies to watch on amazon prime,great historical movies on amazon prime" width=503 height=333 sizes="(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Hansan: Rising Dragon, the second book in the “Kim” trilogy, chronicles the tale of the legendary Joseon naval commander Yi Sun-sin and the real-life Battle of Hansan. ‘Hansan’ starts with the arrival of daimyo Wakisaka Yasuharu at the Japanese base at Busan, five years after the events in the first movie, ‘The Admiral: Roaring Currents,’ which is set in the same time period. He accepts the idea of uniting with the other elements of the Japanese navy after realising the serious weaknesses of the deadly turtle ships that Joseon effectively employed in the earlier conflicts. In the meantime, Yi devises a plan he calls “Crane Wing” to annihilate the opposition. After being attacked, Yi realises that the turtle ships won’t be effective because Yasuharu has probably worked out how to stop them.</p><h3><span id=Kesari_2019>Kesari (2019)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Kesari-5.jpg alt="best historical movies on amazon prime india,best ancient historical movies on amazon prime,best historical movies on netflix,best free historical movies on amazon prime,indian history movies on amazon prime,best historical series on amazon prime,historical movies on amazon prime video,best historical movies on hotstar,best historical movies on amazon prime,best historical drama movies on amazon prime,best indian historical movies on amazon prime,best historical war movies on amazon prime,best historical movies to watch on amazon prime,best historical romance movies on amazon prime,historical movies to watch on amazon prime,great historical movies on amazon prime" width=461 height=250 sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Anurag Singh is the director and co-writer of the war movie “Kesari,” which was released in India in Hindi. The film tells the tale of the Battle of Saragarhi, a bloody conflict in which 10,000 members of the Afridi and Orakzai Pashtun tribes attacked the outpost of Saragarhi, which was defended by the 36th Sikhs of the British Indian Army with only 21 men on duty. When the adversaries were directly facing them, the valiant soldier Havildar Ishar Singh led his men in one of the bloodiest battles recorded in history. The film provides a close-up account of the conflict while also illuminating the events that led to it.</p><h3></h3><h3><span id=Padmaavat_2018>Padmaavat (2018)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Padmaavat_f_improf_861x482.jpg alt="best historical movies on amazon prime india,best ancient historical movies on amazon prime,best historical movies on netflix,best free historical movies on amazon prime,indian history movies on amazon prime,best historical series on amazon prime,historical movies on amazon prime video,best historical movies on hotstar,best historical movies on amazon prime,best historical drama movies on amazon prime,best indian historical movies on amazon prime,best historical war movies on amazon prime,best historical movies to watch on amazon prime,best historical romance movies on amazon prime,historical movies to watch on amazon prime,great historical movies on amazon prime" width=400 height=224 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In “Padmaavat,” Queen Padmavati of Chittorgarh tells the tale of how, after the fort was besieged by the invading Alauddin Khilji, she engaged in “Jauhar,” or the archaic patriarchal practise of self-immolating alongside a hundred or so other women in the face of imminent defeat as a gesture to defend her honour. The movie is everything you’ve come to expect from a Sanjay Leela Bhansali production. The bollywood director is known for his exquisitely detailed, lavishly designed sets and flawless production design set against historical backdrops. When I say this, I also mean that, similar to other Bhansali films, the quality of the craft manages to stick with you even if you don’t take the tale home, especially in this one when the procedures seem stretched out.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u102abc3b235c5e7d268b73d2996a61eb><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Discovering History with the Best Historical Movies on Netflix</span></a><h3></h3><h3><span id=Papillon_2017>Papillon (2017)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Papillon.jpg alt="best historical movies on amazon prime india,best ancient historical movies on amazon prime,best historical movies on netflix,best free historical movies on amazon prime,indian history movies on amazon prime,best historical series on amazon prime,historical movies on amazon prime video,best historical movies on hotstar,best historical movies on amazon prime,best historical drama movies on amazon prime,best indian historical movies on amazon prime,best historical war movies on amazon prime,best historical movies to watch on amazon prime,best historical romance movies on amazon prime,historical movies to watch on amazon prime,great historical movies on amazon prime" width=600 height=300 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The story of Henri Charriere, a man imprisoned after being wrongfully convicted, and the relationship he develops with a fellow prisoner at the legendary Devil’s Island jail as the two attempt to escape is told in “Papillon,” a remake of the cherished 1980s classic starring Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman. You are sure to enjoy viewing this if you can shrug off the shadow of the original, just as this 2017 picture does, because Charlie Hunnam and <a href=#>Rami Malek</a> shockingly embody their parts extremely well in this remake.

The movie provides a dramatised account of the early years of the Chola prince Arunmozhi Varman, who would later rise to power as Rajaraja the Great and restore Chola rule over South India while extending his kingdom to numerous islands in the Indian Ocean. In the opening moments of the movie, Emperor Sundara Chozhar sends Vallavaraiyan Vandiyadevan to his court to investigate what evil may be growing among his attendants. This lavish <a href=#>love letter</a> to India’s past is steered by seasoned director Mani Ratnam with his trademark candour, crafting a great storyline that is ultimately supported by exceptional characters.</p><h3></h3><h3><span id=Sardar_Udham_2021>Sardar Udham (2021)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MV5BM2QwMjk1ZmEtNTc4My00MTk0LWE3NWItYWE3OTQ0MjIwMjFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjQxNDg4OTM@._V1_.jpg alt="best historical movies on amazon prime india,best ancient historical movies on amazon prime,best historical movies on netflix,best free historical movies on amazon prime,indian history movies on amazon prime,best historical series on amazon prime,historical movies on amazon prime video,best historical movies on hotstar,best historical movies on amazon prime,best historical drama movies on amazon prime,best indian historical movies on amazon prime,best historical war movies on amazon prime,best historical movies to watch on amazon prime,best historical romance movies on amazon prime,historical movies to watch on amazon prime,great historical movies on amazon prime" width=446 height=298 sizes="(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>‘Sardar Udham’ by Shoojit Sircar is a sombre, realistic account of one of Colonial India’s most well-known insurgents. The non-linear story of the movie jumps back and forth between the past and present of Sardar Udham Singh (<a href=#>Vicky Kaushal</a>), including his time in London, his connection with the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), and the eventual murder of Indian Civil Service officer Michael O’Dwyer. Udham, who is being for by the British government, travels from Russia to England and kills O’Dwyer. Following his arrest, he tells his story to the investigating inspector and his appointed attorney.

The dramatic changes that Japan experiences as a result of the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 are depicted in the movie. The narrative focuses on Kiku and Tamae, two women who are a part of a team of all-female Sumo wrestlers, as the rise of nationalism happens in the backdrop. In other places, Tetsu and Daijiro join the Guillotine Society, an anarchist organisation with the aim of violently overthrowing their government. When the anarchists start attending the female Sumo tournaments, these two plot lines cross.</p><h3><span id=The_Courier_2020>The Courier (2020)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/anchor_The_Courier_aug_1-e1642707327273.jpg alt="best historical movies on amazon prime india,best ancient historical movies on amazon prime,best historical movies on netflix,best free historical movies on amazon prime,indian history movies on amazon prime,best historical series on amazon prime,historical movies on amazon prime video,best historical movies on hotstar,best historical movies on amazon prime,best historical drama movies on amazon prime,best indian historical movies on amazon prime,best historical war movies on amazon prime,best historical movies to watch on amazon prime,best historical romance movies on amazon prime,historical movies to watch on amazon prime,great historical movies on amazon prime" width=450 height=225 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The Courier, a historical spy movie starring Benedict Cumberbatch, Merab Ninidze, Rachel Brosnahan, and Jessie Buckley, was written by Tom O’Connor. In one of the most tense periods of the Cold War, a British businessman is observed working with a Soviet official in Dominic Cooke’s film. These two men lay the groundwork for defusing the Cuban Missile Crisis and averting the terrible crisis as the threat of nuclear conflict and widespread death and destruction reaches an alarming high.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u23f68e55d5ac5486ed271cbb818ebe4e><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Time Travel with the Best Historical Shows on Netflix</span></a><h3></h3><h3><span id=The_Lost_City_of_Z_2016>The Lost City of Z (2016)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Lost-City-of-Z_f_improf_855x481.jpg alt="best historical movies on amazon prime india,best ancient historical movies on amazon prime,best historical movies on netflix,best free historical movies on amazon prime,indian history movies on amazon prime,best historical series on amazon prime,historical movies on amazon prime video,best historical movies on hotstar,best historical movies on amazon prime,best historical drama movies on amazon prime,best indian historical movies on amazon prime,best historical war movies on amazon prime,best historical movies to watch on amazon prime,best historical romance movies on amazon prime,historical movies to watch on amazon prime,great historical movies on amazon prime" width=360 height=203 sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>My interest in the movie was piqued by the legend of Percy Fawcett, a British adventurer who vanished in the Amazon jungles while searching for the legendary El Dorado, also known as the lost city of Z. Although the picture is technically flawless and occasionally stunning to look at, its plot is quite lacking. Try it out if you like Charlie Hunnam or historical adventures.</p><h3></h3><h3><span id=The_Great_Escape_1963>The Great Escape (1963)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Great-Escape.jpg alt="best historical movies on amazon prime india,best ancient historical movies on amazon prime,best historical movies on netflix,best free historical movies on amazon prime,indian history movies on amazon prime,best historical series on amazon prime,historical movies on amazon prime video,best historical movies on hotstar,best historical movies on amazon prime,best historical drama movies on amazon prime,best indian historical movies on amazon prime,best historical war movies on amazon prime,best historical movies to watch on amazon prime,best historical romance movies on amazon prime,historical movies to watch on amazon prime,great historical movies on amazon prime" width=600 height=338 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>When viewing a historical World War II movie, entertainment isn’t something one thinks of, yet this made me smile. Even though I’m partially citing Thanos, this movie deserves such label. The Great Escape, a terrifying motion picture starring Steve McQueen, Richard Attenborough, James Garner, Charles <a href=#>Bronson</a>, and a host of other well-known actors, tells the story of hundreds of Allied prisoners of war who plot to escape from a German camp after being taken prisoner during World War II. One of the movie’s greatest assets is that despite the large cast of characters—both main and supporting ones—you end up caring about the bulk of them thanks to several excellent introduction moments. Simply put, one of the best WWII films.</p><h3><span id=The_Northman_2022>The Northman (2022)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Alexander-Skarsgard-in-The-Northman.v1-e1650303802782.jpg alt="best historical movies on amazon prime india,best ancient historical movies on amazon prime,best historical movies on netflix,best free historical movies on amazon prime,indian history movies on amazon prime,best historical series on amazon prime,historical movies on amazon prime video,best historical movies on hotstar,best historical movies on amazon prime,best historical drama movies on amazon prime,best indian historical movies on amazon prime,best historical war movies on amazon prime,best historical movies to watch on amazon prime,best historical romance movies on amazon prime,historical movies to watch on amazon prime,great historical movies on amazon prime" width=1500 height=750 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Based mostly on Saxo Grammaticus’ “The Legend of Amleth,” “The Northman” relates the tale of a Viking prince seeking retribution for the death of his father. The story of the movie and the Shakespearean play “Hamlet” are quite similar, despite the latter primarily referencing ancient Nordic mythology. “The legend of Amleth” served as the basis for “Hamlet.” Prince Amleth (Alexander Skarsgrd) is forced to leave the island of Hrafnsey after his royal father is killed by his uncle in a palace coup and his mother is taken away, but not before swearing retribution. Amleth is reminded of his pledge as an adult by a Seeress in the temple of Svetovit. Amleth lets fate take over and lead him to his prey after learning that his uncle lost his kingdom and is now residing in Iceland with Amleth’s mother, whom he married.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt="best historical movies on amazon prime india,best ancient historical movies on amazon prime,best historical movies on netflix,best free historical movies on amazon prime,indian history movies on amazon prime,best historical series on amazon prime,historical movies on amazon prime video,best historical movies on hotstar,best historical movies on amazon prime,best historical drama movies on amazon prime,best indian historical movies on amazon prime,best historical war movies on amazon prime,best historical movies to watch on amazon prime,best historical romance movies on amazon prime,historical movies to watch on amazon prime,great historical movies on amazon prime" itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
