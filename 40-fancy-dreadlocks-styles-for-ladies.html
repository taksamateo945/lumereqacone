One big advantage of having a long dreadlock is that you can take advantage of the long locks and style them into different patterns to suit various occasions or your mood. Below are the top 20 fanciful long dreadlocks styles for ladies who love to rock it long.</p><h3><strong>1. Long dreadlock Mohawk</strong></h3><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img decoding=async fetchpriority=high src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/fcccd5de4515e7ac.jpg alt="Dreadlocks Styles for Ladies" width=1080 height=1080 sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>This style is perfect for ladies who seek to be different. For this style, you have to go all out to nail it. If you intend to look crazy while maintaining a cool look, this is for you. Both sides of the dreadlock Mohawk could be completely barbed or reduced to a considerable extent. You could also twist the long Mohawk to form a ponytail if you wish.

Twisted thick long dreadlocks</strong></h3><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/Capture-9.png alt width=474 height=615 sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>This is another beautiful dreadlock style you could use but it isn’t that easy. Your stylists would have to take great care to ensure every strand of hair gets captured in the lock. When this is done, you will have a beautiful hairdo. This style is great for almost anyone but it’s best for those with thick hair so there wouldn’t be any need for a hair attachment underneath the dreads.</p><h3><strong>3. Twisted thin long dreadlocks</strong></h3><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/Capture-10.png alt="Dreadlocks Styles for Ladies" width=470 height=614 sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Another form of twisted dreadlocks you can rock with confidence.

Edges are those soft hairs that grow along your hairline. They are just like baby hairs, very delicate, and frame your face. Their delicate nature makes it imperative for you to take extra care with them when you are wearing locks so they don’t break or pull out. Let’s consider some techniques you can employ to ensure your locks don’t destroy those edges.</p><ul><li>Wear dreadlock styles that don’t put too much pressure or stress on your edges. This mostly has to do with the length and bulkiness of the dreadlocks. When there is much stress, your edges may fall out. In essence, it’s best to choose the one that suits your hair type and strength.</li><li>It’s advisable you choose dreadlocks styles that don’t start from your edges. Some locks can grow to become quite weighty and this can put stress on your edges. If your lock doesn’t cover your edges, massage them with natural oils. The oil will stimulate growth while strengthening the edges.</li><li>Don’t touch your edges too much if they are exposed and even if they are locked, don’t pull the dread. You can pull out the edges too.</li><li>Choose only the right hats, bandanas, and headbands. A satin scarf is more preferable as it would protect your soft edges. Headbands with silk lining can also go.</li><li>While moisturizing your dreadlocks, don’t forget your edges. They need care too but you have to be careful while at it.</li><li>Apply edge control when you have dreads on but to protect the locks, avoid applying them everyday. Three times a week is okay. Choose only the right products and ensure your edges are damp before applying.</li><li>Only use a soft brush when brushing your locks or edges.</li><li>Be careful with heat. Hair edges don’t like heat due to their delicate nature. While drying your dreadlocks, use a minimal amount of heat or dry naturally after washing.</li></ul><h2><strong>History of Dreadlocks: It Dates Back to the Ancient Times With Spiritual Reverence<br></strong></h2><p>There have been lots of questions about how dreadlocks came into existence. Dreadlocks aren’t new to many people and cultures. There are even speculations that they are as old as the earliest of men and as humanity evolves, different <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>dreadlock styles have also been invented</a>.</p><p>The earliest records show that prominent personalities in ancient Egypt such as the Pharaohs and other important officials of the royal court locked their hair. It was seen as a symbol of wealth and great power at the time. This can be seen from the drawings and carvings of ancient Egypt. Other cultures like the Celts, Greeks, Vikings, Aztecs, and others also wore dreadlocks.</p><p>Dreadlocks have also been seen as a symbol of spiritual authority or status. Many religions ask some special set of people not to comb their hair or even cut it. This is evident in the case of Samson in the Bible. After he lost his dreadlocks, he became powerless against his foes. In the Vedic scriptures, the Hindu god of destruction Shiva was described as wearing dreadlocks. The scriptures called it “jaTaa” (meaning twisted lock of hair).</p><p>In many parts of Africa, people with dreads are treated with some form of respect and some are even feared. In the western and eastern parts of Nigeria for instance, dreadlocks are called “dada” and special children are said to be born with them rather than growing them later in life. It is said that these people bring blessings to their families and are special in terms of strength and health. No one has to touch or cut their dreadlocks as this could make them very sick and they could lose their lives in the process.</p><h3><strong>The Term Dreadlocks is Traceable to Ethiopia</strong></h3><p>We have become so familiar with the name that it’s hard to determine where it came from. The term “dreadlock” can be traced back to 1936–1941 when Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia was forced into exile as the Italians invaded the country. Keen followers and guerilla fighters of the country vowed not to cut their hair until the Emperor was reinstated. Due to this, their hair became locked in a way thought to be frightening and disgusting which led to them being seen as dreadful. The term “dread,” used to describe their locks, later stuck and became known the world over as dreadlocks. Their actions later became an influence in the Rastafarianism religion named after the Emperor’s given name, Ras Tafari, which many Jamaicans adhere to, to date.</p><p>The Jamaicans took dreadlocks to a whole new level. Dreadlocks grew in popularity rapidly in the country just as Rastafarianism grew. Men began sporting this unique hairdo in adherence to the religious instruction given in the Bible, book of Leviticus 21:5, where men were instructed not to make baldness of their head. It didn’t take much time before women in the country followed suit and the use of dreadlocks grew rapidly amongst them. The growth of Reggae music brought dreadlocks into the international limelight and made many people know they can rock the style without any spiritual undertone or implications. Bob Marley, a Jamaican and Rastafarian, through his music generated lots of international interest in dreadlocks.</p><h2><strong>The Changing Narrative in Favour of Dreadlocks in Recent Times</strong></h2><p>At the mention of dreadlocks, the first thought that comes to the minds of many people is entangled and unkept hair arising from the owners’ negligence, filthiness, and/or laziness. This was the picture most people who were yet to see the intricate beauties of dreadlocks, had about them. They were seen generally as a non-formal hairdo which placed some restrictions on who can wear them and where they can be worn to.</p><p>Dreadlocks were thought to be for men alone. Not just any man but those who are spiritually “set-apart.” Aside from these, any other person wearing dreadlocks was seen as wayward, dirty, or lazy. However, this narrative is fast changing in our world today as many people have come to embrace dreadlocks due to their beauty, flexibility, ease of maintaining nature, and the freedom it affords those who adorn it.</p><p>Dreadlock brings beauty to a woman’s face. It also offers convenience and freedom. In this fast-paced world where every lady must be up and doing either in her career or business, spending time on a hairdo can be time-consuming and worrisome. Dreadlocks can help ladies take away this stress. They are easy to style and maintain and do not require much time or resources to do so. Most dreadlocks styles for ladies only require hair cream and brush in the morning. Aside from giving you the attractive, well-arranged, and shiny hairdo, dreadlocks can protect your natural hair. They can aid hair growth while keeping it safe and healthy in great tight locks.</p><h3><strong>Dreadlocks Became the go-to Hairstyle For Ladies at the Turn of the Century</strong></h3><p>The turn of the 21st century saw ladies embracing the dreadlock culture even at a faster rate. They even adorn them in places that are thought “too-formal” for dreadlocks. Many dreadlocks styles for ladies were also developed during the early 2000s (many new styles are still coming up though). From educationists, sportswomen, to actresses and models, many ladies now prefer to wear dreadlocks. High-fliers such as Angela Onwuachi-Willig and Toni Morrison are great lovers of dreadlocks. The former, who is a professor of law and the dean of Boston University’s School of law, has been wearing dreadlocks for many years while Toni, the first black American to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1993, unapologetically adorned dreadlocks during her teaching years.</p><p>Other queens who have significantly grown the popularity of dreadlocks include international beauty queen, Dee-Ann Kentish-Rogers who worn the Miss Universe Great Britain while adorning dreadlocks, Angela Bassett who rocked dreadlocks while acting as T’Challa’s mother in the famous Black Panther movie. The list of dreadlock queens also extends to Lisa Bonet, award-winning TV presenter Whoopi Goldberg who has been on dreadlocks for as long as we can remember, Emmy award-winning movie director, Ava DuVernay, Willow Smith, amongst others.</p><p>It’s now evident that dreadlocks have been embraced by ladies of different walks of life. Another thing worth noting is the confidence, comfort, satisfaction, and beauty they all radiate. Dreadlocks and their different styles have now been adapted to fit into the modern-day fashion and lifestyle of ladies all around the world and they are loving it by the day. You too can fall in love with dreadlocks when you find the right style.</p><p>Overall, dreadlocks are fast becoming rampant when it comes to hairdos for both genders, little wonder new dreadlocks styles for ladies are coming out often.
