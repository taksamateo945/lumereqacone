J. Cook announced her pregnancy, a fact that was carried over to her character Jennifer “JJ” Jareau as well. Showrunner Erica Messer stated in an interview that Cook’s character JJ would not appear for the first five episodes of the season as Cook was on maternity leave.</p><p>Then Does Emily Prentiss get reinstated in season 13? J.J. had to reveal the team was investigating, which cost her her badge. … It was a team effort by the BAU, so <b>he had Prentiss reinstated as a sign of gratitude</b>, which gave her full hiring authority to throw Barnes under the bus and give J.J. her job back.</p><p>Is JJ pregnant again on Criminal Minds? JJ discovers that <b>she is pregnant</b> in the episode “The Crossing” with her partner Will’s child. This pregnancy eventually leads to her temporarily leaving the BAU on a maternity leave during the following season.</p><p>in the same way, Is Cat Adams pregnant? Soon, Cat revealed the canary she was nibbling on: <b>she is pregnant</b>… by Reid!</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_did_Criminal_Minds_get_rid_of_JJ></span>Why did Criminal Minds get rid of JJ?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Despite being a rather foundational member of the BAU team, J.J. was written off of the series during most of Season 6. The in-fiction reason was <b>her forced transfer to the Pentagon, a cover story hiding her real work on a task force in the Middle East</b>.</p><p>Does Hotch return? With the line-up still wide open, some are even wondering if actor Thomas Gibson might return as FBI analyst Aaron “Hotch” Hotchner. It’s not impossible, but given Gibson’s dismissal from the original series, <b>it is unlikely</b>. Criminal Minds ended in the February of 2020 after 15 seasons, and many fans were devastated.</p><p>What happens to Linda Barnes on Criminal Minds? As a result, <b>she successfully obtains the FBI Director’s permission to disband the BAU</b>, reassigning everyone apart from Alvez (Adam Rodriguez) and Simmons, with JJ acting as conditional unit chief, having to run every decision through Barnes. She also forces Rossi into early retirement.</p><p>What does scratch do to Prentiss? As it turns out, Scratch dosed Prentiss with his gas in front <b>of Tara and made her believe that her legs and arm were broken and she was completely out of commission</b>. Scratch made his mistake when he tried to make Prentiss believe that he had killed her by pumping her full of adrenaline to stop her heart.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Was_JJ_cheating_on_Will></span>Was JJ cheating on Will?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“I’ll say it again: <b>They did not and are not having an affair</b>,” the showrunner tells TVGuide.com. “It only seems like they are.”</p><p>Are JJ and Will married in real life?</p><p>What was Reid’s secret?</p><p>Over the course of a few episodes, it’s revealed that he’s had <b>a secret relationship with a geneticist named Maeve</b> (Beth Riesgraf) for months. While it began with discussions about the headaches, it developed into something intimate.</p><p>Who Framed Spencer? Reid later gets released from prison after the BAU manages to prove his innocence. The BAU later realizes that Reid was framed by <b>Lindsey Vaughn</b>, who in ten years became part of an international drug cartel, and Cat Adams, a hitwoman who Reid directly captured in “Entropy”.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Reid_have_a_baby_on_Criminal_Minds></span>Does Reid have a baby on Criminal Minds?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>SSA Derek Morgan decided to leave the BAU.</p><p>Reid with his son’s birth announcement. His baby boy’s name, <b>Hank Spencer Morgan</b>, was named in honor of his late father and his best friend.</p><p>Why does Prentiss leave?</p><p><b>After being refused the provision to audition for a pilot season</b>, and with the final year up on her contract, Brewster decided to quit Criminal Minds with the Season 7 finale. Onscreen, Prentiss was offered a position with Interpol in London, making her departure from the BAU official.</p><p>Why does Spencer Reid carry a revolver? Reed is the smartest person on the team and knows that a revolver is the most reliable weapon in the world. As a competitive shooter for many years I can tell you that I used to <b>shoot semi autos</b> and had too many jams…that’s why I stopped carrying them and started to carry a revolver – they NEVER jam.</p><p>Who is Luke Alvez girlfriend? On Criminal Minds</p><p>Alonso portrayed <b>Lisa Douglas</b>, a doctor who went on a blind date and later engaged in a romantic relationship with Luke Alvez, in the Season Thirteen episode “Bad Moon on the Rise” and in the Season Fourteen episodes “300” and “Luke”.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Morgan_come_back></span>Does Morgan come back?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In the season 3 episode “Clear,” <b>Morgan is revealed to be alive</b> when Rick encounters him on a supply run back in Rick’s hometown. … In season 5, Morgan is shown to have recovered from his mental break and learns that Rick is in Virginia. He eventually finds the Alexandria Safe-Zone and reunites with his old friend.</p><p>Why was Aaron Hotchner fired? Thomas Gibson was fired from Criminal Minds <b>after an on-set altercation</b>. In August 2016, Thomas Gibson was involved in an on-set altercation with Virgil Williams, a writer-producer of Criminal Minds, while Gibson was directing an episode of the show. … Gibson also released a statement.</p><p>What season does Morgan leave?</p><p>He has appeared from the series’ pilot episode “Extreme Aggressor”, which was originally broadcast on September 22, 2005. Before he left in <b>season 11</b>, he was one of only three main characters to appear since the first season as “starring”, while also becoming the only character to appear in all episodes.</p><p>Does Emily Prentiss leave? In the season seven finale, Prentiss receives an offer to run Interpol’s London office. While still pondering her decision on the offer, <b>Prentiss decides to leave the BAU</b>.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Emily_Prentiss_get_reinstated></span>Does Emily Prentiss get reinstated?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>They were able to identify the unsub and catch him before the senator’s daughter dies. The senator was so grateful he said he would see to it that the BAU had full staffing and full funding and <b>reinstated Emily as Unit Chief</b>.</p><p>Does Emily Prentiss leave Criminal Minds? After being refused the provision to audition for a pilot season, and with the final year up on her contract, Brewster <b>decided to quit Criminal Minds with the Season 7 finale</b>.
