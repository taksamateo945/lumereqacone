If yes, then stay with us for a while, as we will bring you closer to one of the “Life Below Zero” stars.</p><p>After moving all other meat from the kill site, it is time for the final load, the head.Photo by Nathaniel “Natcho” Stephens</p><p>Posted by <a rel=nofollow href=#>Glenn Villeneuve</a> on&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>Wednesday, September 19, 2018</a></p><h2><span id=Glenn_Villeneuve_Wiki_Early_Life_Family_and_Education>Glenn Villeneuve Wiki: Early Life, Family, and Education</span></h2><p>Glenn hasn’t revealed much about his childhood years, and as a result, details about his parents remain unknown to the media. However, he has shared with us the fact that he has always loved to explore; he would spend hours in the forest around his house, and every day would go a step further. His love for exploring greatly affected his academic achievements, as he left high school after only one year, and made exploring nature into a full-time job.</p><h2><span id=Career_Beginnings>Career Beginnings</span></h2><p>His eventually moved to Alaska in 1999, and settled in the small town of Chandalar, which is located 200 miles north of Fairbanks and 65 miles north of the Arctic Circle. Once settled, he started exploring the Alaskan wilderness, and in order to survive he had to hunt, living off sheep, moose and caribou meat, while wood was the only way to keep the fire burning. His way of life drew the attention of producers of BBC Worldwide, and he was chosen for the main cast of the new reality documentary series “Life Below Zero”.</p><p></p><h2><span id=Life_Below_Zero>“Life Below Zero”</span></h2><p>Glenn, always wanting to live in remote areas, had his dream come true in the late ‘90s when he moved to Alaska. Fairly rapidly he became accustomed to the harsh climate andenvironment, which led him to become the lead cast of the show “Life Below Zero”. The show premiered on the 19th May 2013, and since then Glenn has appeared in more than 75 episodes of the show, become an idol to a number of people across the world. In addition to the increase in his popularity, Glenn’s net worth also soared in recent years. Alongside Sue Aikens, Chip and Agnes Hailstone, and Andy Bassich, who are also lead cast members, he has made this show so extremely popular, such that it is now in its 11th season.</p><h2><span id=Accidents_and_Dangerous_Situations>Accidents and Dangerous Situations</span></h2><p>Living in remote areas of Alaska is never easy, and there are many dangers lurking around; Glenn lived in a tent while building a proper house, and had a few interesting and dangerous situations over the years in his backyard. Once he was surrounded by a pack of wolves, but managed to escape and return safely to his cabin.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Wolverine In My Yard! <a rel=nofollow href=#>https://t.co/0Im5SBb6oO</a> via <a rel=nofollow href=#>@YouTube</a></p><p>— Glenn Villeneuve (@GlennVilleneuve) <a rel=nofollow href=#>December 17, 2016</a></p><h2><span id=Glenn_Villeneuve_Net_Worth>Glenn Villeneuve Net Worth</span></h2><p>Many have questioned Glenn’s financial status, as he doesn’t have what called a real job, with his only apparent source is his salary from the show. By having two children, he has drawn criticism from the masses, stating that he isn’t a good example as a father, since he seemingly hadn’t provided for the family, before becoming a part of the TV series. Nevertheless, since joining “Life Below Zero”, Glenn’s net worth has increased by a large margin. So, have you ever wondered how rich Glenn Villeneuve is, as of late 2018? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Villeneuve’s net worth is as high as $500,000, while his annual income is around $200,000. Pretty impressive don’t you think?</p><h2><span id=Glenn_Villeneuve_Personal_Life_Marriage_Divorce_Children>Glenn Villeneuve Personal Life, Marriage, Divorce, Children</span></h2><p>Before coming to Alaska, Glenn was already in a long-term romantic relationship with Siliva Daeumichen, whom he met in the ‘90s. She didn’t come to Alaska together with Glenn, but joined him four months later. The two married in 2001 and welcomed their first child, Willow Leaves in May 2006. The two were living in Fairbanks for 15 months after Silvia’s birth, as it wasn’t safe for a newborn to be living remotely in Alaska. Three years later, Glenn and Silvia welcomed their second child, Wolf Song, also born in Fairbanks, however, this time they moved back to wilderness almost immediately after the birth. However, the couple divorced in 2013, after which Silvia and the children went to live in Fairbanks. Since then, Glenn has moved on and is now in a relationship with Trisha Kazan, with whom he has welcomed a daughter, Agatha, born in June 2017.</p><p>Enjoying a family party at our Fairbanks cabin today.
