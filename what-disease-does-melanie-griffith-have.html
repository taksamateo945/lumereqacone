Is Melanie Griffith a cancer patient? According to one account, she has a new fear after being discovered with spots on her left hand. Gossip Cop is on the case.</p><p>Griffith’s discolored hands, according to the National Enquirer, have sparked fears of skin cancer. According to an insider, “everyone is wondering what’s up with Melanie’s scary-looking hands.” The Working Girl star has already battled skin cancer, and fans are concerned that she is resisting treatment.</p><p><a href=#><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/uploads/headlines/2018/08/griffith-marriage.jpg decoding=async alt="What Disease Does Melanie Griffith Have? Allegedly Sparking Cancer Fears After Appearance Reportedly Raises Red Flags, Unverified Report Says" width=1500 height=874 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>One doctor says the blotches are the result of cancer treatment, with liquid nitrogen being used to spray pre-cancerous blemishes off Griffith’s hands. “Dermatologists are making a fortune by spraying these superficial skin pre-cancers,” the doctor says. Griffith has a history of worrying marks on her skin, so an insider concludes, “Her friends just hope this latest flare-up goes away with treatment.”</p><h2>What Disease Does Melanie Griffith Have?</h2><p>Unfortunately, Griffith suffered a&nbsp;<b>recurrence of skin cancer</b>&nbsp;in 2o17, and the resulting treatment left her with bruising on her nose. This content is imported from Instagram. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.</p><p class=body-text>Melanie Griffith has always been candid about everything, from her love life to her&nbsp;<a class=body-link href=# rel=noopener data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/news/a34249/melanie-griffith-interview/>career</a>&nbsp;to her relationship with her kids, and now the actress is issuing an important warning to her fans about&nbsp;<a class=body-link href=# rel=noopener data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/news/a46562/melanie-griffith-reveals-epilepsy-diagnosis/>health</a>.</p><p class=body-text>In 2009, the actress underwent&nbsp;<a class=body-link href=# rel=noopener data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/melanie-griffith-had-skin-cancer-surgery/>surgery</a>&nbsp;to remove early stages of skin cancer from her face. While the procedure left her with a black eye, Melanie’s spokeswoman Robin Baum said it was done early enough to prevent further complications. Unfortunately, Griffith suffered a recurrence of skin cancer in 2o17, and the resulting treatment left her with bruising on her nose.</p><p class=body-text>“It’s a scary thing when you’re an actress and you depend on your face for work,” Melanie told&nbsp;<a class=body-link href=# rel=noopener data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instyle.com/news/melanie-griffith-why-get-married-working-girl>InStyle</a>&nbsp;earlier this month. “But I realize I have to put a Band-Aid on it, and it’s fine. I just look like a dork.”</p><p class=body-text>This week, Melanie posted an update on her now-removed skin cancer, including a plea to fans to take care of their skin as well.</p><p class=body-text>“Bandaged again after having dermabrasion, the final step to fix the now removed [basal] cell skin cancer. If any of you have it, get it fixed. If you lay in the sun, are exposed to lots of sun, be CAREFUL,” she captioned her Instagram photo. “Use&nbsp;<a class=body-link href=# rel=noopener data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/beauty/anti-aging/g1288/best-sunscreens/>sunscreen</a>. Get checked out by your dermatologist. If you don’t have one, get one, or go to your nearest clinic and ask to be tested for it. More info to come!”</p><h2>What’s Going On With Melanie Griffith?</h2><p data-injector-index=1>First of all, the liquid nitrogen doctor has never treated Melanie Griffith. He’s looking at the same exact photos of the rest of us and is openly speculating on what could be going on. You should take his take no more seriously than the idea that the blotches are just marks with crayon.</p><p data-injector-index=2>The rest of this story is one massive bait-and-switch. Its title reads, in big bold letters, “Melanie’s new cancer horror!” The story itself isn’t really about new cancer at all. Instead, we get details of treatment and some fear-mongering from so-called “friends.” Since there’s no actual cancer in the article itself, it’s easy to disregard this story as false.</p><p data-injector-index=1>As for the actress, these marks are old news. Since at least 2019,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-lasso-id=316121>Griffith has had some bruising on her hands</a>. She’s well aware of it,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-lasso-id=321910>electing to wear a Michael Jackson-esque glove</a> on her left hand during an outing last week. At the very least, this glove means we can debunk the idea that Griffith is ignoring her hand. She also wouldn’t be galavanting around Hollywood if her life was in immediate danger.</p><p data-injector-index=1>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-other-griffith-myths>Other Griffith Myths</h2><p data-injector-index=2>The&nbsp;Enquirer&nbsp;is actually late to this skin-bashing party. The&nbsp;Globe&nbsp;ran an identical story last November&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-lasso-id=321911>about Griffith’s apparently worrying skin</a>. It too quoted some clueless doctors in a vain gesture toward legitimacy. We debunked that story for the same reason: You shouldn’t trust what these folks say because they’ve probably never even met her.</p><p data-injector-index=1>Griffith pops up in tabloid stories all the time. She’s apparently&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-lasso-id=316124>feuding with Gwyneth Paltrow</a>&nbsp;alongside her daughter Dakota Johnson. Johnson and Paltrow get along famously, so that was bogus. We also encountered a rumor about&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-lasso-id=316125>Antonio Banderas trying to win her back</a>. He’s been with Nicole Kempel for over 20 years ago, so it sure looks like he’s moved on—unlike the tabloids.</p><p data-injector-index=1>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=exacc_yO0pYvPqHI-clwTsqr2YCA5 class="iDjcJe IX9Lgd wwB5gf">Melanie Griffith Net Worth – How did&nbsp; make her money?</h2><p>Melanie Griffith is an American actress who has a net worth of $40 million. After starting her acting career in the 70s, Griffith rose to prominence during the 80s with a number of notable film roles. Melanie has won a number of awards over the course of her career, including a Golden Globe for her role in “Working Girl.”</p><p>She continued to appear in a number of prominent roles throughout the 90s before pursuing mostly television work throughout the 2000s. Outside of acting, Griffith is also an accomplished producer. She has been in relationships with a number of famous celebrities over the years, including Don Johnson, Steven Bauer, and&nbsp;Antonio Banderas.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Melanie Griffith cuts a stylish figure as she heads to dinner after shopping spree <a href=#>https://t.co/zTURJoHlIj</a></p>— Daily Mail Celebrity (@DailyMailCeleb) <a href=#>March 2, 2022</a><p><strong>Real Estate:</strong>&nbsp;In 2019, it was reported that Melanie had spent $3.7 million on a Spanish-style villa above the Sunset Strip in Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles. She managed to scoop up the 3,000-square-foot residence for a minor discount, as the property was originally listed for $3.85 million. It features tile flooring, a stone fireplace, and a pool in the backyard.</p><p>Earlier in 2019, Griffith sold her 7,391-square-foot retreat in Aspen for $4 million. Apparently, she and her former husband Antonio Banderas had originally purchased the property in 2002 for $3.5 million. Following their divorce, the couple listed it for $10 million before drastically lowering the price and settling on a much lower sum.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Melanie Griffith Allegedly Sparking Cancer Fears After Appearance Reportedly Raises Red Flags, Unverified Report Says</p><p>Is Melanie Griffith suffering from cancer?
