Sebold identified the wrong man in the police line up</h3><p class=mol-para-with-font>Sebold’s attack itself is not in question.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She told police at the time about the

attacker.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Broadwater was in the area at the time of the run-in with the alleged rapist, so he was brought into the investigation.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>At a lineup shortly afterwards, she was asked to identify the rapist but she picked the man standing next to Broadwater.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Cops told her afterwards that she had ‘failed to identify the suspect’ because she didn’t pick Broadwater, the man they were sure she’d walked past in the street.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The police extracted one of his pubic hairs to run a DNA analysis on him and they used that hair analysis to convict him – using technology that is now discredited.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In court, she identified him as her attacker and in her book, she explained the discrepancy as a mistake because he was ‘identical’ to the man she did pick.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In Lucky, Sebold describes the lineup and how she was convinced that it was the man standing in position five who had raped her because he ‘looked at’ her, though she was standing behind a glass panel and they could not see her.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Five black men in almost identical light blue shirts and dark blue pants walked in and assumed their places.&nbsp;“It’s not one, two, or three,” I said,’ she wrote in her memoir.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Broadwater was standing in position four.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I stood in front of number four. He was not looking at me. While he looked toward the floor I saw his shoulders.

I hugged my arms across my chest and stared.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I moved on to number five. His build was right, his height. And he was looking at me, looking right at me, as if he knew I was there. Knew who I was. The expression in his eyes told me that if we were alone, if there were no wall between us, he would&nbsp;call me by name and then kill me…. I approached the clipboard… I placed my X in the number five box. I had marked the wrong one,’ she wrote.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After the lineup, she was told by a Sergeant Lorenz, that she&nbsp;picked out the wrong person.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Alice, it’s my duty to inform you that you failed to pick out the suspect,’ she quoted him saying.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘He did not tell me which one was the suspect.&nbsp;He couldn’t.

My arms were pinned to my sides by his right arm wrapped around me and my mouth was covered with his left.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She goes on to describe the rape in graphic detail, how she had to talk to the rapist to encourage him, telling him he was a ‘good man’ and how she wished it to be over.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She wrote how he then apologized in tears once the attack was over, and told her she was a ‘good girl’.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Sebold describes running back to her dorm, confiding in her friends that she was just ‘beaten and raped’ in the park.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘My face smashed in, cuts across my nose and lip, a tear along my cheek.
