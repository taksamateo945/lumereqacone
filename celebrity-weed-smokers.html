For many stars, there’s a certain allure associated with the lifestyle that comes with being high on weed. They often see it as a way to escape their overwhelming celebrity responsibilities — like interviews, photoshoots, performances, and so forth.</p><p>Celebrity culture can also be quite competitive when it comes to who’s “cooler” between different stars. <a href=# data-type=post data-id=9598>Smoking weed</a> might be seen as an act of rebellion and trying something new among fellow actors or musicians. Many people look up to celebrities — if they’re doing it, others will follow suit in order to fit in.</p><p>Though marijuana use carries some risks and is <a href=# rel=noopener>illegal in many places</a>, celebrities often have access to high-quality strains with incredibly low THC levels. This means that they can get the desired effects without worrying about getting too stoned or having any unwanted side effects. Even so, it’s important to be conscious of these potential risks and make sure that you don’t overdo it.</p><p>Finally, marijuana can also provide a sense of relaxation for those who are constantly under stress. Whether it’s related to their celebrity life or personal troubles, cannabis can help stars find some peace of mind — even if only for a few hours at a time. With all this in mind, it’s no wonder why celebrities like smoking marijuana and getting high on weed.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>9 Celebrities You Didn’t Know that Smoke Marijuana</h2><p>The use of marijuana and weed by celebrities has been a topic of debate for many years. It is widely accepted that it is a recreational drug, but there are also those who see it as a natural medicine or pain reliever. Despite this fact, many well-known celebrities still continue to smoke in public today — here are some of the most notable ones.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d01e7ecc.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/bigstock-LOS-ANGELES-FEB-Miley-C-288096085-1024x678.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Miley Cyrus</h2><p><a href=# data-type=post data-id=29892>Miley Cyrus</a> is one of the most well-known celebrities who openly admits to smoking marijuana. She has become a poster child for cannabis culture, often seen wearing clothing and accessories that contain references to her love for the substance. Miley’s music also often contains lyrics about weed, including her hit single “We Can’t Stop” which contains a reference to “blazing on the barbeque.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d01e7ecc.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/bigstock-Jennifer-Lawrence-at-the-Los-A-111651467-scaled-e1659120939704-1024x745.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jennifer Lawrence</h2><p><a href=# data-type=post data-id=29557>Jennifer Lawrence</a> is another high-profile celebrity who enjoys smoking marijuana.

He might be one of the more low-key celebrity smokers on this list, but there have been reports that he enjoys partaking in the occasional puff or two when away from prying eyes. It seems his love for marijuana goes back to his early days in Hollywood, as he was reportedly caught by police in 1988 for possession of cannabis.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Celebrities Enjoying the High Life</h2><p>All these celebrities and many others prove that enjoying a little marijuana every now and then doesn’t make you any less successful or famous – it just makes you human!
