She has been raised in a proper household under the guidance of her parents.</p><p><strong>Alexis Sofia Cuban</strong> is the eldest daughter of American entrepreneur and television personality <strong>Mark Cuban</strong> and <strong>Tiffany Stewart</strong>. As of 2021, her father has a <a href=#>net worth</a> of an estimated $4.2 billion, according to Forbes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Alexis Sofia Cuban Wiki; Age, Birthday, Parents, Siblings, Ethnicity</h2><p>Alexis was born in 2003 in the United States that makes her 17 years of age. Her birthday falls on 25 September every year, and her birth sign is Libra. The eldest daughter in the family, her parents, is Mark Cuban and Tiffany Stewart.</p><p>Mark and Tiffany first met at the gym and married after five years of dating in 2002. Their private wedding ceremony was held in Barbados. Her father, Mark, is the owner of the NBA side Dallas Mavericks, co-owner of 2929 Entertainment, and the chairman of AXS TV.</p><p>Meanwhile, her mother, Tiffany, 51, is a media personality who worked as an advertising executive. Alexis grew up with two younger siblings; a sister named <strong>Alyssa Cuban</strong> and a brother named <strong>Jake Cuban</strong>.</p><p>She is Ashkenazi Jewish by ethnicity, and her great-grandparents emigrated from Russia to the United States. Alexis’s birth sign is Libra.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Is Alexis Sofia Cuban Doing Now?</h2><p>Alexis is still at her young age and has not been involved in any profession. Besides, she is currently pursuing her high school education in the United States’ prestigious educational institution.</p><p>According to the wiki sources, she had a <a href=#>paid internship</a> last summer and earned her own money. Moreover, she saved most of her earnings rather than spending. A self-made billionaire, Mark also wants his kids to be financially independent.</p><p>The young celebrity is enjoying her family life and is often seen attending numerous events with her family.</p><p>She was seen with her parents and siblings in events such as the 2016 and 2017 American Music Awards and the 2017 Nickelodeon’s Kids’ Choice Awards.</p><h2><strong>Mark Cuban Wants Kids To Work!</strong></h2><p>The billionaire investor wants his little ones to be independent in terms of finances. According to the <a href=#>Cheat Sheet</a>, he can afford to spot his children, but that does not mean he will.</p><p>It is because most of the viewers of Shark Tank know the outspokenness of Mark and his advocacy to praise people who work with passion and determination that becomes the pinpoint of accountability and commitment to selling their brand image.&nbsp;</p><p>Mark has worked really hard to be a celebrated entrepreneur. At the age of 12, he peddled a garbage bag to purchase a brand new pair of expensive basketball shoes.</p><p>He was raised by a working-class Jewish family in Pittsburgh, and no matter how high he is in his career prospect, his feet are still on the ground to stay humble. Mark does not want his kids to be entitled jerks, and after their health, he encourages them to get jobs and start earning money.</p><p>Likewise, Mark has expressed concern that his kids will be too rich to be likable. He has told his daughter Alexis that she won’t be touching his fortune. Cuban told ABC that Alexis knows she will not be rich as much as her father. He adds, “She knows she’s going to have to earn it herself.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Personal Life; Is She Dating Anyone?</h2><p>When it comes to the use of technology, the teenager and her siblings are guided by their father. Mark is much stricter and wants to protect his three kids from the misuse of technology.</p><p>Alexis, who grew up in a quite strict household, is yet to reveal her dating status. She has not revealed her possible boyfriend despite being active in social media, including Instagram and Snapchat. She often posts enjoying moments with her friends on her Instagram account.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Some Interesting Facts About Alexis Sofia Cuban</h2><ul><li>Alexis has about 43k Instagram followers and more than 400k followers on TikTok.</li><li>Her parents had planned to marry in Jamaica, but Storm Isadore ruined their plans.</li><li>Mark revealed in a 2018 interview that he embarrasses Alexis by rolling down the windows and blasting hip-hop music while driving her to the school.</li><li>She resides with her parents and siblings on a 24,000-square-foot French chateau-style mansion in the affluent Preston Hollow neighborhood of Dallas, Texas.</li><li>In 2017, her father revealed that he is suffering from arterial fibrillation is still <a href=#>recovering</a> from the condition.</li><li>Alexis and her father were seen rocking out to the metal band Unearth in a 2019 TikTok video.&nbsp;</li><li>Her paternal grandfather <strong>Norton Cuban</strong> died at the age of 92 in July 2018.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FPqJuirZ1jsLC5jpqjnrCZqHq0u8WimGabpZeur3nMmqmkZZOqr6K60mabmq2XncGmvoywoKShXZa0pnnFmqSipKliwKS0zqijZp6RmMG0ew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2falexis-sofia-cuban-mark-cubans-daughter-wiki-age-family-school-facts.html&text=Alexis%20Sofia%20Cuban%20%28Mark%20Cubans%20Daughter%29%20Wiki%3b%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20School%20%26amp%3b%20Facts&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2falexis-sofia-cuban-mark-cubans-daughter-wiki-age-family-school-facts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2falexis-sofia-cuban-mark-cubans-daughter-wiki-age-family-school-facts.html&title=Alexis%20Sofia%20Cuban%20%28Mark%20Cubans%20Daughter%29%20Wiki%3b%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20School%20%26amp%3b%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2falexis-sofia-cuban-mark-cubans-daughter-wiki-age-family-school-facts.html&title=Alexis%20Sofia%20Cuban%20%28Mark%20Cubans%20Daughter%29%20Wiki%3b%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20School%20%26amp%3b%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2falexis-sofia-cuban-mark-cubans-daughter-wiki-age-family-school-facts.html&title=Alexis%20Sofia%20Cuban%20%28Mark%20Cubans%20Daughter%29%20Wiki%3b%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20School%20%26amp%3b%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2falexis-sofia-cuban-mark-cubans-daughter-wiki-age-family-school-facts.html&description=Alexis%20Sofia%20Cuban%20%28Mark%20Cubans%20Daughter%29%20Wiki%3b%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20School%20%26amp%3b%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-john-snowling-camarillo-mass-shooting-incident.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The John Snowling Camarillo Mass Shooting Incident">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tiny-harris-throws-t-i-a-spectacular-star-studded-party-photos-show-all-their-kids-toya-wright-phaedra-parks-and-more-having-a-great-time-325273.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tiny Harris Throws T.I.
